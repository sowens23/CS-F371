  ### Chapter 1: Why Ethics
  - Ethics is a set of moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity.
  - Computer Ethics is the set of commonly agreed principles that govern the use of computers. These can be discerned into two categories:
    - Broadly, it can include professional practice standards, codes of conduct, computer law, public policy, corporate ethics, computer psychology, and sociology.
    - Narrowly, it can include traditional ethical theories superimposed onto computer technology.
  - **Normative Ethics** is a branch of ethics that examines what is morally right and wrong, and how people should act.
  - **Descriptive Ethics** (Comparative Ethics) is a branch of ethics that studies people's beliefs about morality without making judgement.
