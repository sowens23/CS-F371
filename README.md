  - **Natural Rights** are universal and exist independently of any legal framework.
  - **Legal Rights** are 
  - **Intellectual Property**
    - Rights involving intangible things can be granted by governments.
    - These and similar rights are known collectively as **intellectual property (IP)**
    - **Patents** are rights of inventors to control manufacture, use, and sale. Trade IP and in return are granted a monopoly of manufacture and sale of product. Usually last about 20 years.
    - **Trademarks** are rights of individuals or businesses to have sole use and control of recognizable expression. 
      - (tm) is a trademark symbol, which identifies a product offered for sale.
      - (sm) is a trademark symbol, which identifies that a non-physical product is for sale.
      - (R) is a trademark registered with the appropriate government agency.
    - **Copyrights** are rights of authors to control copying, modification, and distribution.
      - (c) is the general copyright symbol identifying legal right of an author to control the reproduction, transmission, distribution, and public performance or display of a creative work. (This does not apply to ideas, only created work)
      - (p) Phonogram copyright used for recordings.
      - The only copyright legally bound to never expire is for Peter Pan owned by Ormond Street Hospital
      - The US adopted **Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works** which naturalized copyright for every piece of works upon creation. Thus "Copyrighted Material" is completely unnecessary, and one does not need to "copyright" there work. It's automatic.
  - Those who hold the intellectual property rights, are said to **hold** or **own** these rights.
  - They may grant these rights to other entities for periods of time. Violating these rights is to **infringe** on these rights.
  - In 1983 the Federal Court Circuit decided that Software falls under human expression and is subject to Copyright.
  - If you make something you hold the copyright for it. However you can **register** your copyright to the library of congress, if you think it's a big deal. This serves as a more official record to prove copyrights.
    - The library holds a copy of everything that has ever been copyrighted.
  - **Works for hire** is the default copyright where the entity that pays someone to make something will hold the copyright once the product has been produced.
    - Contracts can further define or alter the legality of who holds the copyright of a product.
    - A **Copyright release** which would acknowledge that you are the copyright holder in situations of questionable circumstances.
  - When creative works are not copyrights, they are considered to be in the **public domain**.
    - The following are always in the public domain;
      - Works that the copyright holder has explicitly placed in the public domain.
      - Works which the copyright has expired.
      - Works by US Federal Governments.
      - Laws and court decisions at any level.
      - Representations of works i the public domain in other media.
      - Works created by non-human animals.]

  - An Identity Matrix, is when there is an equal amount of rows and columns, with 1's filling the main diagonal and 0's elsewhere.
    - You can have an identity matrix of 2x2, 3x3, 10x10, etc.
  - We can reshape the matrix by transposing a matrix. This is an operation that changes the positions of rows and columns.

  ### Chapter 1: Why Ethics
  - Ethics is a set of moral principles that govern a person's behavior or the conducting of an activity.
  - Computer Ethics is the set of commonly agreed principles that govern the use of computers. These can be discerned into two categories:
    - Broadly, it can include professional practice standards, codes of conduct, computer law, public policy, corporate ethics, computer psychology, and sociology.
    - Narrowly, it can include traditional ethical theories superimposed onto computer technology.
  - **Normative Ethics** is a branch of ethics that examines what is morally right and wrong, and how people should act.
  - **Descriptive Ethics** (Comparative Ethics) is a branch of ethics that studies people's beliefs about morality without making judgement.
